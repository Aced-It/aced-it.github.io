        <h1 class="hero-heading">Our Story</h1>
        <p class="paragraph hero-description"><span class="paragraph-text-2">Aced It! is an online tutoring service created so that education can reach everyone. Not all children have the ability to attend a school or get help with their work outside of school. Aced It! allows students and kids to have access to tutors who are experienced in a variety of subjects. Not only does Aced It! do this, but students can volunteer and if approved they become a tutor and in return can receive service hours. This allows for a zero-cost education system for every student to receive education and enhance their knowledge. Also, we created Aced It! so that students have access to resources to continue learning amid this pandemic and have the opportunity to succeed to their fullest. Education is a necessity and it is our goal to make sure that education is not an idea but it is something that every single child has the opportunity to have.
